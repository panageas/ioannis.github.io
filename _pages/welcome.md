About Me
======
I am an Assistant Professor in the department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.uci.edu/), in the [Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Science](https://www.ics.uci.edu/) at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/), the [Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems (CML)](https://cml.ics.uci.edu/) and the [Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization Center (ACO)](https://acoi.ics.uci.edu/). Prior to that I was an Assistant Professor in [Information Systems](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). Before that I was a MIT Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Costis Daskalakis](http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/). I obtained my PhD in [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO)](https://www.aco.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prasad Tetali](https://tetali.github.io/). At Georgia Tech, I also obtained a MSc in Mathematics. I did my undergrad studies in [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). <br/>

Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5NiFWuwAAAAJ&hl=en) and my [dblp](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panageas:Ioannis) profiles. <br/>

Interests
======
I am interested in theory of computation and its interface with optimization, dynamical systems, probability and statistics, machine learning and their applications to multi-agent Reinforcement Learning. Here is my [CV](https://panageas.github.io/files/panageascv2021.pdf).
