About Me
======
I am an Assistant Professor in [Information Systems](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). Before that I was a MIT Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Costis Daskalakis](http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/). I obtained my PhD in [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO)](https://www.aco.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prasad Tetali](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~tetali/). At Georgia Tech, I also obtained a MSc in Mathematics. I did my undergrad studies in [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). <br/>

Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5NiFWuwAAAAJ&hl=en) and my [dblp](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/p/Panageas:Ioannis) profiles. <br/>
<b> Received NRF Award for AI (2019-2024) </b>. Thank you NRF!! <br/>
